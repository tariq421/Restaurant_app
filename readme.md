Project 2.

This project was somewhat a journey. I ran into A LOT of errors. That didn't stop me ofcourse. I managed to get myself around some of the errors to have my project functions but then I would run into more errors that I would get stuck in. I got to the point where I can funtion the basics of the project. Even though I have ran into these problems that did not put me down. I know that I tried my best to do the project and TRY to complete it as best as I can. If I did not try my best and just let it be then I would of felt somewhat guilty for not putting in my best efforts. But I know that I put in the time and work to do my best.

I learned so much from this project. Learned somethings that I had no knowledge of before. I learned things that during class I would be lost about. I learned that patience is key. Before this project we had another project that I think was more okay with that one then with this one but I was more happier than to do this one then that one. Because I learned so much more in this project.

The approach I took into this project was the approach our instructors said to take, dont rush, figure out what you are going to do first, I visualized, I drew and then I started. The beginning was probably the hardest because I didn't exactly know the way I should start besides the basics which was to set of the application before actually setting up the pages layout and all that.

I did get frustrated but I did not lose hope, I have been coding for only 6 weeks, brand new into it and I proud of my progress because it is not easy. Of course I won't stop here and just get better at my craft.
